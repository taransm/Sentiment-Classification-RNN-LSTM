# Sentiment Classification using bidirectional RNN with LSTM

The benefits of marketing in e-commerce have grown more obvious with the fast expansion of the Internet.mConsumers, on the other hand, find it difficult to pick among a wide range of similar items. Consumers provide input on the purchasing process in the form of remarks, which influences the purchasing choices of other users.These perspectives are useful for making decisions. People want to hear what others have to say before making a choice, while businesses want to keep an eye on what people are saying about their goods and services on social media and take necessary action. Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI) is the systematic
identification, extraction, quantification, and study of emotional states and subjective information using natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics,and biometrics. Sentiment analysis is commonly used in marketing, customer service, and clinical medicine to analyze opinion of the customer materials such as comments and survey replies. 


In today's marketing techniques, it's critical to understand client attitudes. It will not only provide firms with information about how their consumers perceive their goods and/or services, but it will also provide them with suggestions on how to enhance their offerings. This project aims to decipher the relationship between several characteristics in customer reviews on a women's clothes e-commerce site, as well as categorize each review as to whether it suggests the reviewed product or not, as well as if it contains positive, negative, or neutral attitude. To accomplish these objectives, I used univariate and multivariate analysis on dataset characteristics, as well as a bidirectional RNN with LSTM for sentiment classification and recommendation.


I discovered that the bidirectional LSTM could get an F1-score of 0.88 for recommendation classification and 0.93 for sentiment classification using the bidirectional LSTM.
